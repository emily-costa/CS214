Flex Example 1
----------------
This part of the code is reading in the input translated in to the tokens and then compares it to
determine the output.  

Flex Example 2
----------------
Input -> Output

123 -> NUMBER
a23 -> WORD
a -> WORD

1_2_3 -> NUMBER _NUMBER _NUMBER
a_23 -> WORD _NUMBER

When I include an underscore into my input, the tokenizer separates each string 
and it reads it as each individual section. The underscore also gets printed in the output.

Bison Example 4
----------------
Terminals represent indiviual symbols and no not have branches. 
Non-temrinal have nultiple symbols and have branches.
